# IA - Search Agents

These are the search agents where your goal is to find a set of instructions that lead to a solution. First we will give a brief description of the agents.

**Bredth-First Search Agent** (AgentBFS) is an agent performs its actions by expanding each node and them adding to the end of fringe.
**Depth-First Search Agent** (AgentDFS) is an agent  performs its actions by plunging deeply into the expansions of each node.

The other agents are a variation of these two.

**Uniform-Cost Search Agent** (AgentUCS) is an variation of AgentBFS, this agent always looks for the lowest costs of the instruction sets.
